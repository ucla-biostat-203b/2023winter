```

Load necessary libraries (you can add more as needed).

MIMIC data location
```{r}
mimic_path <- "~/mimic"
```

In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2023winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

Display the contents of MIMIC data folder. 
```{r}
system(str_c("ls -l ", mimic_path, "/"), intern = TRUE)
system(str_c("ls -l ", mimic_path, "/core"), intern = TRUE)
system(str_c("ls -l ", mimic_path, "/hosp"), intern = TRUE)
system(str_c("ls -l ", mimic_path, "/icu"), intern = TRUE)
```

## Q1. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading plain text data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. 

Which function is fastest? Is there difference in the (default) parsed data types? (Hint: R function `system.time` measures run times.)

For later questions, we stick to the `read_csv` in tidyverse.

## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are
```{r}
system(
  str_c(
    "zcat < ", 
    str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/icustays.csv.gz"), 
    " | head"
    ), 
  intern = TRUE
)
```

1. Import `icustatys.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`. 

2. How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? 
3. Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs. 

4. For each `subject_id`, let's only keep the first ICU stay in the tibble `icustays_tble`. (Hint: `slice_min` and `slice_max` may take long. Think alternative ways to achieve the same function.)

## Q3. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{r}
system(
  str_c(
    "zcat < ", 
    str_c(mimic_path, "/core/admissions.csv.gz"), 
    " | head"
    ), 
  intern = TRUE
)
```

1. Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`.

2. Let's only keep the admissions that have a match in `icustays_tble` according to `subject_id` and `hadmi_id`.

3. Summarize the following variables by graphics. 

    - admission year  
    - admission month  
    - admission month day  
    - admission week day  
    - admission hour (anything unusual?)  
    - admission minute (anything unusual?)  
    - length of hospital stay (anything unusual?)    
    
## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/core/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{r}
system(
  str_c(
    "zcat < ", 
    str_c(mimic_path, "/core/patients.csv.gz"), 
    " | head"
    ), 
  intern = TRUE
)
```

1. Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/core/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble` and only keep the patients who have a match in `icustays_tble` (according to `subject_id`).

2. Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age`, and explain any patterns you see.

## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are
```{r}
system(
  str_c(
    "zcat < ", 
    str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"), 
    " | head"
    ), 
  intern = TRUE
)
```
`d_labitems.csv.gz` is the dictionary of lab measurements. 
```{r}
system(
  str_c(
    "zcat < ", 
    str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz"), 
    " | head"
    ), 
  intern = TRUE
)
```

1. Find how many rows are in `labevents.csv.gz`.

2. We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble` as a tibble `labevents_tble`. 

    Hint: `labevents.csv.gz` is a data file too big to be read in by the `read_csv` function in its default setting. Utilize the `col_select` option in the `read_csv` function to reduce the memory burden. It took my computer 5-10 minutes to ingest this file. If your computer really has trouble importing `labevents.csv.gz`, you can import from the reduced data file `labevents_filtered_itemid.csv.gz`.

3. Further restrict `labevents_tble` to the first lab measurement during the ICU stay. 

4. Summarize the lab measurements by appropriate numerics and graphics. 

## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patientâ€™s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are
```{r}
system(
  str_c(
    "zcat < ", 
    str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/chartevents.csv.gz"), 
    " | head"), 
  intern = TRUE
)
```
`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`. 
```{r}
system(
  str_c(
    "zcat < ", 
    str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/d_items.csv.gz"), 
    " | head"), 
  intern = TRUE
)
```

1. We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), mean non-invasive blood pressure (220181), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble` as a tibble `chartevents_tble`.

    Hint: `chartevents.csv.gz` is a data file too big to be read in by the `read_csv` function in its default setting. Utilize the `col_select` option in the `read_csv` function to reduce the memory burden. It took my computer >15 minutes to ingest this file. If your computer really has trouble importing `labevents.csv.gz`, you can import from the reduced data file `chartevents_filtered_itemid.csv.gz`.

2. Further restrict `chartevents_tble` to the first vital measurement during the ICU stay. 

3. Summarize these vital measurements by appropriate numerics and graphics. 

## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are the first ICU stay of each unique adult (age at admission > 18) and columns contain at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `patients.csv.gz`  
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vital measurements during ICU stay
- an indicator variable `thirty_day_mort` whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission (30 day mortality)

## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize following information using appropriate numerics or graphs.

- `thirty_day_mort` vs demographic variables (ethnicity, language, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at hospital admission)

- `thirty_day_mort` vs first lab measurements

- `thirty_day_mort` vs first vital measurements

- `thirty_day_mort` vs first ICU unit
