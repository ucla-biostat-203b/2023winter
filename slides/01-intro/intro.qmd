## Statistics and data science

- Statistics, the science of *data analysis*, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century.

- Data is increasing in [volume, velocity, and variety](http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2012/01/19/volume-velocity-variety-what-you-need-to-know-about-big-data/).

- My favorite definition of a *data scientist*:

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

| Data Size | Bytes          | Storage Mode               |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| tiny      | $10^2$         | piece of paper             |
| small     | $10^4$         | a few pieces of paper      |
| medium    | $10^6$ (MB)    | a floppy disk              |
| large     | $10^8$         | hard disk                  |
| huge      | $10^9$ (GB)    | hard disk(s)               |
| massive   | $10^{12}$ (TB) | hard disk(s); RAID storage |

## Who are hiring data scientists?

Following tables is based on a survey of 403 students who earned a master's degree in statistics, biostatistics, or a related field (actuarial science, data science, informatics, math with stats focus) during the 2019--2020 academic year.

## Course description

-   This course introduces some computing skills and software tools for handling potentially big public health data in a reproducible way.

-   Read [syllabus](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2023winter/syllabus/syllabus.html) and [schedule](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2023winter/schedule/schedule.html) for a tentative list of topics and course logistics.
